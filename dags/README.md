# GPT2 TFX Pipeline Configurations
This repository contains the configurations for all the experiments I did. It is split up in two folders:
- `train-on-wikipedia`: This folder contains the configurations for training on german wikipedia to generate a model, which will be used as a pretrained model.
- `train-on-newspipe`: This folder contains the configurations for training on news articles directly from MongoDB
